  // 5. Implement an object model that allows you to store strings that represent a Photo.
  // Your model should include an Album object that can contain many Photo objects in its photos attribute.
  // Each Album should allow you to add a new photo, list all photos, and access a specific photo by the order it was added. 
  // Each Photo should tell you the photoâ€™s file name and the location the photo was taken in.
  // Create instances of each object defined to prove that your object model works
